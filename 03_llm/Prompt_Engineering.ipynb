    "***\n",
    "AI21 Jurassic 2 Models supports many advanced parameters while performing inference. Here are some commonly used parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **maxTokens:** The maximum number of tokens to generate per result. Optional, default = 16. If no stopSequences are given, generation is stopped after producing maxTokens\n",
    "* **numResults:** Number of completions to sample and return. Optional, default = 1\n",
    "* **temperature:** Modifies the distribution from which tokens are sampled. Optional, default = 0.7 Setting temperature to 1.0 samples directly from the model distribution. Lower (higher) values increase the chance of sampling higher (lower) probability tokens. A value of 0 essentially disables sampling and results in greedy decoding, where the most likely token is chosen at every step. â€‹\n",
    "* **topKReturn:** 0 <= integer <= 10, Optional, default = 0. Return the top-K alternative tokens. When using a non-zero value, the response includes the string representations and logprobs for each of the top-K alternatives at each position, in the prompt and in the completions.\n",
    "* **topP:** Sample tokens from the corresponding top percentile of probability mass. Optional, default = 1. For example, a value of 0.9 will only consider tokens comprising the top 90% probability mass.\n",
    "* **stopSequences:** Stops decoding if any of the strings is generated. Optional. For example, to stop at a comma or a new line use [\".\", \"\\n\"]. The decoded result text will not include the stop sequence string, but it will be included in the raw token data, which can also continue beyond the stop sequence if the sequence ended in the middle of a token. The sequence which triggered the termination will be included in the finishReason of the response.\n",

    "We may specify any subset of the parameters mentioned above while invoking an endpoint. Next, we show an example of how to invoke endpoint with these arguments\n",

    "1. Give the model the current problem context and have it suggest possible next steps or decide if the problem is unsolvable.\n",
    "2. Choose the most promising next step, and repeat step (1)\n",
    "3. If the problem is solved, exit. If the problem seems unsolvable from the current state, back-track to one of the previous states and try a different next step.\n",

    "This method can significantly out-perform CoT and other approaches for problems where sequential decision-making is required. We won't demonstrate it here from scratch, because it's a bit more complex to set up - but you can find open source implementations online. For more information see this [guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/tot).\n",
