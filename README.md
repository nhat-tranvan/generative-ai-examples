In this module, you will learn how to perform short and long-form abstractive text summarization and question answering for legal documents. This module demonstrates a streamlined pipeline that combines three NLP tasks - abstractive text summarization, question generation, and answer generation via abstractive question answering. All of these tasks are accomplished using a single foundation model in a zero-shot setting with prompt engineering.

In this notebook we will demonstrate how to use **AI21 Contextual Answer** to answer questions using a library of documents as a reference, by using document embeddings and retrieval. The embeddings are generated from **All MiniLM L6 v2 embedding model** embedding model.
